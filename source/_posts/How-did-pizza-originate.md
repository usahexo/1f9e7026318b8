#  How did pizza originate?

There are many different claims to how pizza originated. However, the most accredited story is that pizza was first created in Naples, Italy. The story goes that in the 18th century, a poor baker named Raffaele Esposito was asked to make a cake for Queen Margherita. Esposito decided to make a cake with red tomatoes, green basil, and white mozzarella cheese to represent the colors of the Italian flag. The queen enjoyed Esposito's cake so much that she named it "pizza".

Even though pizza is now popular all over the world, it is still considered an Italian dish. You can find some of the best pizza in Naples, where it was invented. In fact, there is even a museum in Naples dedicated to the history of pizza.

#  What are the original toppings on a pizza?

#  What kind of oven do you need to make a proper pizza?

There is a lot of debate about what the best oven for making pizzas is. Some people swear by using a pizza stone, while others say that an electric oven with a broil setting is the key to getting that perfect pie. In this article, we will explore the different types of ovens that can be used to make pizzas and discuss the pros and cons of each option.

One type of oven that is commonly used for making pizzas is the traditional brick oven. These ovens are usually found in pizza restaurants and are known for their ability to produce a crispy crust. Brick ovens are expensive to install and operate, so they are not ideal for use at home.

Another option for baking pizza is a pizza stone. Pizza stones are designed to evenly distribute heat and produce a crispy crust. They can be used in both electric and gas ovens, and can also be placed on the grill. One downside to using a pizza stone is that they can be difficult to clean.

If you want to make a quick and easy pizza at home, an electric oven with a broil setting is your best bet. Broiling allows you to quickly heat the top of your pizza while leaving the bottom nice and crunchy. Just be sure to keep an eye on your pie while it’s cooking, as it can burn easily if left under the broiler for too long.

#  How should you store pizza dough?

When you are cooking pizza, the dough is one of the most important parts of the process. It needs to be stored properly so that it is soft and fluffy, and can be cooked perfectly. Here are a few tips on how to store pizza dough:

1. Make sure that your dough is covered properly. If it is not covered, it will dry out and become unusable.

2. Place the dough in a container or bag that is airtight. This will help to keep the moisture in, and will keep the dough from becoming dry.

3. Store the dough in the refrigerator. This will help to keep it fresh, and will prevent it from spoiling.

4. Allow the dough to come to room temperature before using it. This will make it easier to work with, and will result in a better pizza crust.
