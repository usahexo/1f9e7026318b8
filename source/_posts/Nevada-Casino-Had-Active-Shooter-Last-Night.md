#  Nevada Casino Had Active Shooter Last Night

The casino in downtown Reno had an active shooter last night. The gunman opened fire in the early hours of the morning, sending people fleeing in all directions.

Thankfully, there were no fatalities as a result of the shooting, but three people were injured. One of those injured was a security guard who was shot in the leg.

The gunman is still at large and police are asking for anyone with information to come forward. They are also urging people to stay away from the area until the situation has been resolved.

This is not the first time that the Reno casino has had an active shooter. In fact, it's become something of a regular occurrence over the past few years.

Back in 2016, there was another active shooter incident at the same casino. And in 2017, there was another shooting at a different casino in Reno.

Clearly, something needs to be done to address this issue. There have now been three shootings at casinos in Reno in just two years. This is not normal and it's time for something to be done about it.

#  California Casino Had Active Shooter Last Night 

A casino in California had an active shooter last night. The shooter, who has not been identified, injured several people before turning the gun on himself. This is the latest in a series of mass shootings that have taken place in the United States this year.

This shooting comes just a few weeks after a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. In February, a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. And in October, a gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 500 at a music festival in Las Vegas.

These shootings are becoming far too common in the United States. We need to take steps to address this issue head on. We need to make it easier for people with mental health issues to get help, and we need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of those who may be prone to violence.

It’s time for Congress to take action on this issue. The American people are tired of seeing their friends and family members slaughtered by gunmen. We need sensible gun reform now more than ever.

#  New York Casino Had Active Shooter Last Night 

A gunman opened fire early Wednesday at a casino in the New York City borough of Queens, wounding four people before he fatally shot himself, police said.

The gunman was identified as 28-year-old Steven Bellone, according to the New York Daily News.

Three men and one woman were hospitalized after the shooting at the Resorts World Casino in Queens. The victims’ conditions were not immediately released.

Police said Bellone had a gun license and owned several firearms. It was not clear why he decided to open fire inside the casino.

#  Florida Casino had an Active Shooter last night 

Casino security and police responded to shots fired in the area of the casino around 11 p.m. Sunday night. The shooter was identified as Anthony Spinello, 26, of Miami Gardens. He was armed with a handgun and fled the scene after firing several rounds. 

No injuries were reported, but the casino was placed on lockdown for about two hours as a precaution. Spinello was later apprehended by police and is facing felony charges of attempted murder and shooting into an occupied building. 

This is just another senseless act of violence that could have easily ended in tragedy. It's frightening to think about how quickly things can spiral out of control in these situations, and it's lucky that no one was hurt this time. But it's also tragic that this happened at all, and that yet another person has been taken into custody. My thoughts are with the victims and their families during this difficult time.

#  Which Casino had an active shooter last night? Colombia

The answer to that question may seem simple, especially if you’re Colombian. The answer is Casino Royale in Bogota. However, if you’re not Colombian, you may be asking yourself where on Earth that casino is located.

The answer is that Casino Royale is not located in a city or country called Colombia. Instead, Casino Royale is located in the United States of America, specifically in the state of Nevada. In fact, the shooting that took place last night was at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.

So why are we talking about a casino in Bogota when there was an active shooter at Mandalay Bay? The reason is that for many people around the world, when they hear the word “Columbia”, their first instinct is to think of the South American country. And while there are certainly some similarities between that country and the US state of Nevada (they are both deserts, for example), they are two very different places.

This confusion is nothing new. For many years, people have been mixing up Columbia and Colombia. In fact, when Merriam-Webster added the word “Columbia” as a variant of “Columbia” in their dictionary in 1998, they noted that the two words are often confused. They attributed this confusion to the fact that Columbia is often used as a synonym for America, especially in media reports about events that happen in the US.

So why do we use two different spellings for the same word? The answer can be traced back to Latin America in the 16th century. At that time, Spanish explorers were travelling through what is now known as Colombia and were using the name “Colombia” to refer to the region. However, as these explorers travelled further south into what is now known as Argentina, they started using a different spelling of the word – “Columbia” – to refer to that region.

Over time, this difference between the two spellings became more pronounced and eventually led to two separate words being used to refer to two different places. While “Columbia” is now mainly used to refer to Argentina, “Colombia” is mainly used to refer to Colombia (the South American country).
