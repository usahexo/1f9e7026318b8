#  Casino CashOccino game is on the rise!

Casino CashOccino is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Since it was first introduced in land-based casinos, it has gradually gained a following among online casino players as well. The game is easy to learn but hard to master, which is probably why it has become so popular.

The basic premise of Casino CashOccino is very simple. You are dealt two cards, and the aim is to make as much money as possible by betting on the value of your hand. There are three different bet options: high, low and tie. If you think that your hand is worth more than the dealer’s, you can place a high bet; if you think it is worth less, you can place a low bet; or if you think they will be equal, you can place a tie bet.

The game starts with the player making their first bet. They then receive their first card. If they want to stay in the game, they must place another bet that is double the size of their first bet. This second bet is also called the ‘main bet’. Once both players have made their decision, both players receive their second card. If the player has two queens or better, they win automatically – there is no need to place an additional wager.

If your first two cards are of equal value (e.g. two eights), you have two options: either split your hand into two separate hands and play them as individual hands, or keep them together and play them as one hand (this option only applies if your casino allows doubling after splitting). If you split your hand, each new card becomes the first card of a new hand, and you must place an additional bet equal to your original main bet on each new hand. If you keep your hand together, you must place an additional bet equal to your original main bet in order to continue playing (known as doubling down).

The aim of Casino CashOccino is simple – beat the dealer! The best strategy for doing this depends on what cards you are initially dealt, but here are some general tips:

* Always remember that when considering whether to hit or stand, the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

* If your first two cards total 10 or 11, always hit – unless the dealer has an Ace (in which case stand). This increases your chances of getting closer to 21 without going over.

* If your first two cards total 12-16 inclusive, hit if the dealer has 2-6 showing; otherwise stand. This decreases your chances of going bust while still giving you a good chance of winning.

* If your first two cards total 17-21 inclusive (i.e. a ‘hard’ 17-21), always stand – otherwise you may go bust!
