#  Buffalo Hunter Sheriff Plays Blackjack in Vegas

It was a long day on the job for Sheriff Tom as he patrolled the ranch lands outside Buffalo, Wyoming. He had to rustle up a couple of roughed-up steers that had gotten loose and were causing a ruckus on the highway. After lunch, he hit the casino in downtown Buffalo for a little relaxation.

He sat down at a blackjack table and started to play. The cards were hot and he was winning big. The sheriff was feeling lucky and decided to up the stakes. He put his last $500 on the table.

The dealer turned over an ace and Tom thought he was home free. But then the dealer turned over another ace, giving him two aces. Tom busted with his card total of 12 and lost all his money.

The sheriff was not happy about this turn of events. But he figured he still had a good day overall – catching those steers and then blowing through $500 in just a few minutes at the blackjack table!

#  Vegas Sheriff Hunts Buffalo, Plays Blackjack

LAS VEGAS- The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is on the hunt for a buffalo that has been on the loose in the city since Monday.

The buffalo, which was initially spotted near the Strip, has led officers on a wild goose chase throughout the city, dodging them at every turn. The buffalo was last seen Wednesday morning at a local blackjack table inside of a casino.

"This is a very dangerous animal," said Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the LVMPD. "We are doing everything we can to capture it, but it's proving to be a challenging task."

Officers say they are not sure where the buffalo came from, but they believe it may have been brought to Vegas specifically to cause havoc.

"We've never seen anything like this before," said Sergeant Randy Sutton of the LVMPD. "This buffalo is definitely up to no good."

In addition to the search for the buffalo, authorities are also investigating reports of several blackjack tables being rigged in casinos across town. So far, no arrests have been made, but detectives are confident that they will catch the culprits soon.

"We will get to the bottom of this," said Deputy Chief Kevin McMahill of the LVMPD. "And we will make sure that justice is served."

In the early morning hours of January 2nd, Buffalo Sheriff's Deputy Tony Lopez was on his way to work when he noticed an SUV driving erratically on the I-190. He pulled the vehicle over and learned that the driver, a 41-year-old man from Tonawanda, had been drinking and was on his way to the casino.

Lopez, a former Marine and avid hunter, recognized that the driver was in no condition to be on the road. He called for backup and detained the man until additional officers arrived.

The driver was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated. Thanks to Deputy Lopez's quick thinking and sharp hunting skills, another potentially deadly crash was averted.
