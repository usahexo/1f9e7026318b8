#  What are the odds at cloudbet? 

 Cloudbet is one of the leading Bitcoin gambling websites and they offer different odds for each sporting event. The odds at Cloudbet are similar to those offered by other major sportsbooks, with a slight edge to the house.

For most events, Cloudbet offers two types of odds – fractional and decimal. Decimal odds are easier to understand because they represent your payout if you bet 1 unit. Fractional odds represent how much you will get paid out if you bet 100 units. For example, fractional odds of 5/1 mean that if you bet 100 units, you will receive 500 units back plus your original 100 unit bet (making a total of 600 units). 

Here is a list of the current Cloudbet betting odds for some popular events:
