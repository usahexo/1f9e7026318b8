#  What are the objectives? 

There are a few main objectives that a business should have in mind when undergoing a digital marketing strategy:

1. Increasing Brand Awareness 
2. Driving Conversions and Sales 
3. Improving Customer Loyalty 
4. Generating Leads 
5. Enhancing Website Visibility 
6. Building Relationships with Customers 
7. Measuring Results and ROI 
8. Optimizing Efforts for Greater Results

# Increasing Brand Awareness 
One of the primary goals of digital marketing is increasing brand awareness. This can be accomplished by creating a consistent digital presence across all channels, targeting the right audience, and creating engaging content. When done correctly, brand awareness will increase, resulting in more customers discovering your business and products/services.

# Driving Conversions and Sales 
Another key goal of digital marketing is to drive conversions and sales. This can be done by optimizing website design and user experience to create a smooth purchase process, using effective call-to-action buttons, and creating targeted content that encourages potential customers to buy what you’re selling. In order to track success, it’s important to measure conversion rates and sales totals before and after the launch of your digital marketing campaign. This data can then be used to improve your efforts for greater results in the future.

# Improving Customer Loyalty 
Happy customers are essential for any business – they are more likely to return as customers, refer their friends, and spend more money over time. One goal of digital marketing is to improve customer loyalty by delivering an exceptional customer experience across all channels, from website visits to customer support interactions. This can be done through exemplary customer service, personalized offers/communications, and valuable content that helps customers solve their problems or meet their needs. As customers become more loyal, businesses see increased profits and strengthened relationships with their customers base.

There is no definitive answer to this question since the cost of a tattoo can vary significantly depending on the artist, the design, the size and the location of the tattoo. However, on average, a small or medium-sized tattoo will typically cost between $50 and $100. Larger tattoos can cost significantly more, up to several hundred dollars or even more.

# How long does it take?

Once again, there is no definitive answer as the time it takes to complete a tattoo can vary significantly depending on its size and complexity. However, on average, a small or medium-sized tattoo will take between one and two hours to complete. Larger tattoos can take significantly longer - up to eight hours or more.

# What are the risks?

Like any other type of medical procedure, getting a tattoo involves some degree of risk. Though rare, some people experience adverse reactions to tattoos such as skin irritation, infection or allergic reaction. In addition, if the tattoo is not done correctly or if it is not properly taken care of after it is completed, there is a risk for permanent scarring.
