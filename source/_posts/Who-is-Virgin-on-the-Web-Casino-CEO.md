#  Who is Replacing Virgin on the Web Casino CEO?

Replacing Virgin on the Casino web CEO is an interesting story. It seems that no one quite knows who is taking over for the departed Richard Branson. Speculation abounds, but no clear answer has yet emerged.

One name that has come up a lot in recent weeks is that of Gary Loveman. He is the former CEO of Caesars Entertainment and has a great deal of experience in the casino industry. However, he has also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Jeff Zients at the head of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This could throw his plans into question.

Another name that has been floated around is that of Charles Dunstone. He is the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and also has a great deal of experience in the technology sector. He would be a good choice to head up an organization that is increasingly moving into the online realm.

Whoever replaces Virgin on the Casino web CEO will have some big shoes to fill. Richard Branson was highly respected within the industry and was known for his innovation and willingness to take risks. It will be interesting to see who steps up to fill his shoes.
